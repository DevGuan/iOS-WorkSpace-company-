<p><em>Michael Ciurus</em> is an iOS developer at Jodel. He likes to blog about his Swift adventures. His love of computer games has led to him to look what’s under the hood.

<p><em>Richard Critz</em> is on career number three as a professional photographer (after first being a software engineer doing mainframe O/S development for 20+ years and then a stint as a corporate pilot) doing contract iOS development on the side. Some would say he just can’t make up his mind. Actually, he just likes diversity! When he’s not working on either of those, he’s probably playing League of Legends (with or without the rest of his family). On Twitter, while being mainly read-only, he can be found at @rcritz. The rest of his professional life can be found at <a href="http://www.rwcfoto.com">www.rwcfoto.com</a>.

<p><em>Mic Pringle</em> is an iOS developer by trade, but he’s recently found himself dabbling in Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. An F1 nut at heart, Mic enjoys spending time with his wife Lucy and their daughter Evie, watching his beloved Fulham F.C. and, weather permitting, tearing up the English countryside on his motorbike.
